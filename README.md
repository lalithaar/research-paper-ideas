# research-paper-ideas
scratchbook of research ideas I thought of, free for anyone to use and implement from
some are just ideas, some have fleshed out concepts or even latex drafts - as I said, it's a sratchbook

This ideas are shared here under the Idea Protocol ([IP-ZERO](https://lalithaar.github.io/idea-protocol/v0.1/ip-zero)). Absolutely free for any use. No credit required - unless it's a derivation of one of my works, in which case academically you would have to cite the paper, but this would only strengthen your argument, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel or eshtablish all the concepts again and basically do the work I already did - once again. But if you do like to geek out and start afresh, please feel free to do so. I mentioned citing the previous work purely for the sake of not doing extra work or coming across as plagarism.

This is an analogous scratchbook to the [ideabank](https://github.com/lalithaar/ideabank/), where you can check out project based ideas

You can check out my research papers [here](https://arxiv.org/a/ar_l_2.html) if you want more context 

## food science and packaged foods related - specific to India
The Adaptive Informatics Challenge in Indian Packaged Food Health Scoring

in a nutshell, india has loads of packaged foods right, but why is it so hard to come up with a stable food rater that could tell us how healthy a packaged food is

you gotta analysis across food safety regulations, Computational Gastronomy and Food Informatics—the area known as the Ingredient Interaction Problem and other similar areas to draft the paper

check `packaged-foods/` folder for rough paper outline and also detailed potential analysis along with literature review to help you out

## mental health - specific to India


# who can implement this or use the ideas here?
This is an idea bank — a scratchbook of concepts, half-formed thoughts, and hopeful seeds.
You’re welcome to take anything here and run with it, remix it, or ignore it completely.
All I ask in exchange is:
- ✧ Please be kind to yourself.
- ✧ Take good rest.
- ✧ You don’t have to attribute me (unless you want to).

That’s it. Go make cool things. :>

I know some of these ideas are valuable. I know they could blow up, or be well funded. I know it may sound stupid to share but I dont care, to anyone who wants this idea - take it, just make sure to take good rest, be gentle and kind with yourself, sleep and eat well. You dont have to attribute me. If it succeeds, whether in funding, business or just in making you kinder, I am happy with that. I have someone I love with all of me and want to give all of my time to. Love the journey of building, while I love the journey of loving him 
With love,
His <33
